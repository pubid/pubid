  # Every failure pubid raises.
  #
  # The three classes below have three different superclasses, chosen so that
  # code written against the old contract keeps working: relaton-cli rescues
  # `Parslet::ParseFailed`, and the input guards have always raised
  # `ArgumentError`. What unifies them is the marker module
  # {Pubid::Errors::Error}, which every one of them includes, so a caller that
  # wants "pubid could not do this" writes one rescue:
  #
  #   begin
  #     Pubid::Iso.parse(reference)
  #   rescue Pubid::Errors::Error => e
  #     warn e.message
  #   end
  #
  # A URN failure deliberately does not inherit `Parslet::ParseFailed`: no
  # grammar runs, so there is no parse failure to report.
  module Errors
    # Marker module included by every pubid error. Rescue this to catch all
    # of them, whatever their superclass.
    module Error; end

    # A printed identifier could not be turned into an identifier object.
    #
    # Raised for a grammar rejection, and also for the few flavors that reject
    # an input before the grammar runs (a CSA comment line, a bad ISBN check
    # digit). Those synthetic failures carry no parslet cause, so
    # {#parse_failure_cause} is nillable — check it before calling
    # `ascii_tree` on it.
    #
    # v1's `Pubid::Core::Errors::ParseError` flattened the cause into the
    # message and threw the object away. This one keeps it.
